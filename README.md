# Totally not Jarvis

This is my attempt at building a personal assistant bot with Telegram. Currently, the functionality is limited to fetching the weather forecast just to play with some bot concepts and explore the API.

Features I'd love to implement:
- record memos of meetings (based on a calendar integration)
- get recommendations to keep in touch with people you have not contacted for a while (hubspot integration)
- send meeting reminders via email or sms (based on calendar and hubspot contacts)
- log current position on demand
- save reminders
- let others talk to the bot and play with it
